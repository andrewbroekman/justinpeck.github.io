I am a software developer who cut his teeth on the membrane keyboard of the [ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81), 
and I've been a professional web developer for [over twenty years](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geezer). 

You might know me as one of the founders of the location-based mobile strategy game [QONQR](https://qonqr.com), 
or maybe you just know me from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinpeck).

Perhaps you just stumbled onto this page completely by accident. In that case, here's what else you should know [About Me]{:.heading.flip-title}, 
and please feel free to peruse my [Blog]{:.heading.flip-title} or check out the [Projects]{:.heading.flip-title} I'm working on right now.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto://justinpeck@gmail.com), or just follow along on my [day-to-day adventures](https://instagram.com/justinpeck)!
