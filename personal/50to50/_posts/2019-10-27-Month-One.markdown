I realized today that I’m 50 months away from being 50 years old. 

At first that seemed shockingly close, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized 
that *I CAN DO SO MUCH* in fifty months to make significant improvements to my life and the lives of the people around me.

So here is my commitment: I will make one small change every month between now and December 24th, 2023. 
I will share each change and my progress publicly. I want to see what’s possible in 50 months.

**Month #1**: I will track my calories every day and step on the scale every morning. 
I’ve had good luck with this in the past but stopped doing it for reasons that I can’t even remember. 
Here in Month One of my #50to50 challenge, I’m recommitting to the practice.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on small habit suggestions for future months, your own systems for success, 
and feedback on the choices I’m making! Thanks!
